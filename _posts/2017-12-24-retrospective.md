*Part twenty-four of [a series of posts about automated
 testing](http://tech-blog.cv-library.co.uk/tags/#advent-2017-ref).*

We've reached the last day of Advent, and Christmas is nearly upon us.

Traditionally Advent is a time of preparation; in the case of
CV-Library as a whole, we are preparing for the January rush of job
seekers fulfilling their New Year's resolutions!  In the case of these
blog posts, we are preparing to make 2018 our best-tested year yet.

Looking back at the contents of the posts, I'm feeling good that we've
covered a good cross-section of automated testing; from unit tests to
end-to-end tests, with a bit of general code advice and process
discussion in there too.

On the negative side, I'm aware that there's only so much that a
high-level blog post can cover; we need to get down to details, and
document more examples of interesting test situations.  Perhaps that's
something we can do more of next year.

For now, thank you for reading!  If you have any feedback or
questions, drop us an email - the address is at the foot of the page.
