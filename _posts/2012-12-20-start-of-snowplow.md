One year ago, I was surprised and scared when Mathew and JJ chose me as a key 
person for Snowplow at our company. At the time, we had no 
standard processes in place for capturing events and objects, and there was no 
development specifically dedicated to this task. 

As we began our journey with Snowplow, we quickly realized that we had a lot of 
work ahead of us. We held numerous meetings to discuss our approach and to 
brainstorm ideas for how to effectively use Snowplow to capture and analyze 
data. We also reached out to the Snowplow team for guidance and advice on best 
practices. 

One of the biggest challenges we faced at the outset was the lack of 
standardization in our data collection processes. We had a lot of siloed 
systems and tools in place, and it was difficult to determine how to integrate 
Snowplow in a way that would allow us to effectively capture and analyze data 
across all of these systems. 

To address this challenge, we spent a lot of time working on establishing 
clear, consistent guidelines for data collection and analysis. We also put a 
lot of effort into educating our team members on the importance of data 
integrity and the role that Snowplow plays in helping us maintain it. 

Despite these challenges, we were able to make significant progress in our 
Snowplow implementation over the past year. We were able to establish clear 
guidelines for data collection and analysis, and we were able to integrate 
Snowplow with a number of our existing systems and tools. 

One of the key areas where Snowplow has had the biggest impact for us is in our 
ability to track and analyze candidate behavior. By capturing data on candidate 
interactions with our products and services, we have been able to gain a much 
deeper understanding of our candidates and their needs. This has allowed us to 
make more informed decisions about how to improve our products and services, 
and it has also helped us to identify new opportunities for growth. 

Overall, the past year has been a challenging but rewarding journey for our 
team as we have worked to implement Snowplow and use it to capture and analyze 
data. While there have been many challenges along the way, we are now in a much 
better position to make data-driven decisions and to continually improve our 
products and services. 

As we look ahead, we are excited to continue leveraging Snowplow to capture and 
analyze data to drive our business forward. We are committed to continuously 
improving our data collection processes and to using data to inform our 
decision-making. 

One area where we see a lot of potential for growth is in using Snowplow to 
track and analyze data from our marketing efforts. By capturing data on the 
effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, we can identify which strategies are 
working and which ones are not, and make adjustments accordingly. This will 
allow us to be more efficient with our marketing spend and to get better 
results for our business. 

In addition to tracking and analyzing candidate behavior, we are also interested 
in using Snowplow to capture and analyze data on the performance of our 
internal systems and processes. By tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) 
such as uptime, response time, and error rates, we can identify areas for 
improvement and make changes to increase efficiency and productivity. 

Overall, we are excited to continue using Snowplow to capture and analyze data 
and to drive our business forward. We are committed to using data to inform our 
decision-making and to continuously improving our products and services, and we 
look forward to the insights and improvements that Snowplow will bring.
